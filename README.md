## Description
A simple CMS style employee management system run on the command line.  Run it by running "npm init -y" then running "node server.js" in the command line.  You will also need to run the schema.sql and seeds.sql in MySQL Workbench or somewhere equivalent.
Once the program starts, it will ask you what you would like to do.  Options are: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employees role.  All of these functions use database queries to do exactly what they say they do to the sql database that holds all of the data.  There is a link to the walkthrough video in the deployment section of this README.
